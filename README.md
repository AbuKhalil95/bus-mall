# bus-mall
Youâ€™ve been hired by a startup called BusMall, whose product is similar to the SkyMall catalog found in the seatback pockets on airplanes: a catalog of assorted high-markup products provided to a captive audience seeking a mental escape from the drudgery of travel. The difference with BusMall is that instead of their catalog being placed in airplanes, they are placed on local buses while commuting through traffic.

The objective would be to make a survey of sorts, that would choose between pictures that won't repeat both in display and from our previous displayed items.

The results are included in a bar chart, pie chart and another bar chart to display the total recorded statistics.
